# Makefile
Makefile for running tests on Apple MacBook

## Problem: 
  - Makefile for subject Programiranje2 at Faculty of Computer and Information Science (University of Ljubljana) does not work on Apple MacBooks

## Requirements:
  - homebrew
  - brew install coreutils
 
## Solution
There are two (known) possible errors:
   - error timeout => remove "--ignore-trailing-space" from Makefile or copy contents of Makefili/simple/
   - error timeout and illegal character N => copy contents of Makefili/advanced/
